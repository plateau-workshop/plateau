      Programming languages exist to enable programmers to develop software effectively. But programmer effectiveness depends on the usability of the languages and tools with which they develop software. The aim of this workshop is to discuss methods, metrics and techniques for evaluating the usability of languages and language tools. The supposed benefits of languages and tools cover a large space, including making programs easier to read, write, and maintain; allowing programmers to write more flexible and powerful programs; and restricting programs to make them more safe and secure.
      </p>

      <p>
      PLATEAU gathers the intersection of researchers in the programming language, programming tool, and human-computer interaction communities to share their research and discuss the future of evaluation and usability of programming languages and tools.

    Workshop Goals
    </div>

    <div>
    <p>
    PLATEAU 2019 will revolve around two activities:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="boldish">Research Presentations and Mentoring:</span> Junior researchers will present their work, and our panel of experts will provide feedback and advice.</li>
      <li><span class="boldish">Discussion of Standards:</span> We will hold a community discussion of evaluation standards and model paper structures for this important emerging field.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <span class="boldish">Research Presentations and Mentoring:</span> PLATEAU serves as an important source of feedback and career advice for junior researchers working in the HCI+PL domain.  Starting this year, we will be joined by an invited panel of experts to put this goal front and center.  The panel will take the lead in facilitating constructive discussions and providing feedback to the authors of accepted papers.  (Check back for updates on who will constitute the panel!)  This portion of the workshop will serve many of the same goals as a doctoral symposium, but it will offer that style of mentorship to a broader range of researchers&#8212;undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers and any others who consider themselves junior researchers.
    </p>
    </div>

    <p>
    <span class="boldish">Discussion of Standards:</span> As PL+HCI becomes an increasingly important field of study, we must develop (i) standards for evaluating work and (ii) model paper structures.  In particular, we aim to develop standards to help guide the program committees and journals that review work at the intersection of HCI and PL.  For PLATEAU's Discussion of Standards session, the organizers and the panel of experts will facilitate a community discussion of these topics.

    What to Submit
    </div>

    <div>
    <p>
    We encourage both standard research papers and more unusual works&#8212;for instance, papers that describe works-in-progress or recently completed work, report on experiences gained, question accepted wisdom, raise challenging open problems, or propose speculative new approaches.
